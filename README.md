# RadeonClockEnforcer

RadeonClockEnforcer is a single AutoHotkey script that forces maximum clocks while important applications are open. Automates OverdriveNTool's clock/voltage switching functionality for GPU and VRAM, with the purpose of enforcing maximum clocks while whitelisted applications are in focus. RCE uses application whitelists/blacklists and is fairly robust albeit very simple.

## Instructions:
1. Download the release .zip and extract the main \RadeonClockEnforcer folder anywhere.
2. Follow the .lnk shortcut from \RadeonClockEnforcer to download OverdriveNTool.exe and place it in that folder.
3. Read \RadeonClockEnforcer\RCE\README_RadeonClockEnforcer.txt, which will tell you to also read the OverdriveNTool docs.
4. After that, set up both of your OverdriveNTool profiles as suggested from \RadeonClockEnforcer\RCE\OverDriveNTool_example.png.
